"""Tests for the SPACE-toggle guards on SO107Leader.

Targets ``_try_toggle_intervention`` directly so the lock + debounce
logic is validated without pynput listeners or hardware.

The bug class these guard against: a 2nd SPACE press during the 1-3s
servo-sync transition (policy → intervention) used to silently toggle
back to policy mode, wasting the entire sync round-trip. After the
fix, presses during the transition window are rejected; quick
double-taps are also caught by the time-debounce.
