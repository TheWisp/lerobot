"""Train vs inference parity tests for the RLT pipeline.

Purpose: prevent silent distribution mismatches between how S1 was trained
and how its features are consumed at RLT inference time. One such bug was
present for weeks before these tests existed — the RL token encoder was
trained on contexts built from *normalized* observation.state, but at
inference the pre-RLT code fed it *raw* joint values. This file is the
guardrail.

Scope: focuses on the flow_matching S1 policy with DINOv2 backbone, which
is the policy used for RLT. ACT-VLM is covered by smaller-scope tests and
has intentional xfail markers where its preprocessing doesn't yet match.
