"""Tests for ``EpisodeLifecycle`` — the per-episode state object that
replaces the prior racy ``reward_triggered`` / ``abort_triggered`` /
``ignore_triggered`` flags on ``rlt_state``.

The structural fix here is the one-shot ``consume_terminal_for_storage``
contract: even if the inference thread fires N times during the post-
signal window, exactly one of those calls gets the terminal kind, the
rest get ``None`` and write intermediate transitions. Real bug
observed at ep124: 17 ``done=True`` transitions written instead of 1.
The threading test below locks that fix in.
