"""Integration regression: GUI must successfully reload hf_dataset after recording.

The May 2026 incident: ``_check_and_reload_metadata`` (and ``reload_hf_dataset``)
tried to do ``dataset.hf_dataset = ...``, which raises ``AttributeError`` post-
refactor (hf_dataset became a read-only property on the facade). The exception
was caught and logged, so:

  1. Recording adds an episode (info.json mtime updates)
  2. GUI auto-detection runs ``_check_and_reload_metadata``
  3. Metadata reloads OK, but hf_dataset reload silently fails
  4. GUI shows N+1 episodes in the episode list (metadata says so)
  5. User clicks the new episode → backend tries ``dataset[2117]``
  6. hf_dataset still has 2023 rows → ``IndexError: out of bounds for size 2023``

Refresh of the GUI re-instantiated the dataset, masking the bug.

These tests guard against that shape regressing.

    2219 (info.json reload OK) but ``len(hf_dataset)`` stayed at 2023 (data
    reload silently failed via swallowed AttributeError). User clicks new

    Test strategy: open a dataset, then re-create it on disk with the same root
    but more frames. The on-disk state now has both updated info.json and
    updated parquet — but the in-memory handle is stale. Reload should resync
    both halves of the dataset. The assertion is on the public surface
    (``num_frames`` vs ``len(hf_dataset)``) so it stays meaningful even if the
    internal layout changes again.
