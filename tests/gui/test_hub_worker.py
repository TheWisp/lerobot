"""Tests for the Hub-transfer worker subprocess.

We spawn the worker as a real subprocess (not just import + call ``main``)
because the worker:
  - installs SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers that we test against
  - redirects stderr at the file-descriptor level
  - writes its own PID file

All of those need a real process to exercise correctly. We mock the
``huggingface_hub`` calls inside the worker so the tests don't hit the
network, but the IPC + signal handling + PID-file lifecycle are real.
