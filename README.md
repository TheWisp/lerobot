<!-- <h3 align="center">Lerobot Studio</h3> -->

This repository tracks Hugging Face [LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot)
and adds three things on top of it:

1. **A browser GUI** for reviewing, editing, and recording robot datasets — and
   for launching training runs, including on ephemeral cloud GPUs.
2. **An MCP server** so any AI tool you already use (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor,
   Claude Desktop, …) can browse your datasets, leave durable comments, and drive
   the GUI — using _your_ AI subscription, no extra API key.
3. **New policies** — a hierarchical dual-system VLA (**HVLA**) and online RL
   fine-tuning via an **RL Token** (**RLT**).

Everything upstream LeRobot does — `LeRobotDataset`, the policy zoo, hardware
drivers, `lerobot-train` / `lerobot-record` / `lerobot-teleoperate` — still works
exactly as documented. This README focuses on what's _different_. For the core
library, see the [upstream documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/index).

## Key additions over upstream

| Area                         | What's new                                                                                                                                                                 | Where                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GUI**                      | Browser tool to play / trim / delete / record dataset episodes, manage robot profiles, and launch training. LAN-discoverable via mDNS (`lerobot.local`).                   | [`src/lerobot/gui`](src/lerobot/gui/README.md)                             |

| **HVLA policy**              | Dual-system VLA: a slow VLM (S2) supplies scene understanding; a fast action policy (S1) generates action chunks conditioned on S2's latent.                               | [`src/lerobot/policies/hvla`](src/lerobot/policies/hvla/README.md)         |
| **RLT**                      | Online RL fine-tuning of a _frozen_ HVLA S1 policy using a lightweight TD3 actor-critic over a learned "RL token".                                                         | [`src/lerobot/policies/hvla/rlt`](src/lerobot/policies/hvla/rlt/README.md) |

Also extended: higher-rate bimanual SO-107 teleop with predictive control, Quest VR
and scripted end-effector teleoperators, Cartesian IK, latency instrumentation, and a
broader policy set (`act_vlm`, `groot`, `sarm`, `wall_x`, `xvla`, `pi05`, …).

## Installation

This fork installs from source (it carries extra dependencies — GUI, MCP, cloud —
behind optional extras) and uses [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheWisp/lerobot.git
cd lerobot

uv sync --extra gui --extra mcp        # GUI + AI-native server
# add --extra nebius                    for ephemeral cloud training
# add --extra dataset                   for video decoding in the MCP tools
# uv sync --extra all                   for everything
```

Run any LeRobot command through `uv run` (e.g. `uv run lerobot-info`).

---

## The GUI

A browser-based tool for reviewing and editing robot training datasets, managing
robot/teleop profiles, and launching training.

```bash
uv run lerobot-gui --port 8000
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8000/>, enter a Hub repo ID (e.g. `lerobot/pusht`) or a
local dataset path, then:

- **Play** episodes across all cameras with timeline scrubbing
- **Trim** episodes to keep only the useful frames (→ save)
- **Label** episodes with tags or reward / quality columns
- **Record** new episodes by teleoperation
- **Train** policies locally or on cloud GPUs
- **Run** a trained policy on the robot

  <img alt="Record then replay an episode from the GUI" src="./media/readme/record_replay.gif" width="70%">
</p>

### Open it from another device

Bind to the network and the GUI advertises itself over mDNS, so a laptop, tablet,
or phone on the same LAN can reach it without knowing the host's IP:

```bash
uv run lerobot-gui --host 0.0.0.0
```

```
LeRobot host service ready:
  mDNS (no IP needed): http://lerobot.local:8000/
  LAN:                 http://192.168.1.61:8000/
  Local:               http://localhost:8000/
```

> [!WARNING]
> Binding to the network has no authentication — anyone on the LAN with the URL
> can drive your robot. Fine for a lab/home network; not for untrusted WiFi.

Full details, keyboard shortcuts, and caveats: **[GUI README](src/lerobot/gui/README.md)**.

## AI-native control (MCP)

Connect the AI tool you already use to LeRobot via the
[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). The AI browses your
datasets, leaves comments that survive across sessions and tools, and drives the
GUI tab you have open — all powered by **your** existing AI subscription. No
separate API key, no "LeRobot AI account".

The GUI process mounts the MCP endpoint automatically at `/mcp`, so one command
serves the GUI, the AI-setup page, and the MCP transport on a single port:

```bash
uv run lerobot-gui --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Each user, on their own device, issues a scoped token from `lerobot.local/ai_setup`
and registers it with one line, e.g. for Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add lerobot \
  --transport http \
  --url http://lerobot.local:8000/mcp \
  --token sk-lr-XXXXXXXX
```

Then, from your AI tool:

> _"What lerobot datasets do I have? Show me the last frame of episodes 0–9 of
> `<dataset>`, tag the ones that look successful, and open the first failure in my
> GUI."_

Tokens carry one of four nested scopes — `read` ⊂ `comment` ⊂ `edit` ⊂ `operate`
— so you grant exactly as much authority (up to and including starting hardware
runs) as the situation warrants. The full tool surface, scope model, and design
rationale are in the **[MCP README](src/lerobot/mcp/README.md)**.

## Policies

### HVLA — Hierarchical VLA

A dual-system VLA for bimanual control, inspired by
[Helix](https://www.figure.ai/news/helix),
[OpenHelix](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03912), and
[Dual Process VLA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15549).

```
S2 (slow, ~4–15 Hz)            shared memory          S1 (fast, ~22–30 Hz)
 4 cams → SigLIP                ┌──────────┐           2–4 cams → DINOv2/ResNet
 task text → Gemma 2B  ──latent→│ [2048]   │←─ read ── state + latent + age
 mean-pool → [2048]             │ + age(s) │           → ACT / flow-matching
 (VLM, no action expert)        └──────────┘           → action chunk (14-DOF)
```

S2 (a VLM) provides scene understanding at low rate; S1 generates action chunks at
high rate conditioned on S2's latent plus a learned _age_ embedding that accounts
for how stale the latent is. S1 can also run standalone (`--zero-s2`).
See the **[HVLA README](src/lerobot/policies/hvla/README.md)**.

### RLT — RL Token for online fine-tuning

Online RL fine-tuning of a **frozen** HVLA S1 policy using a lightweight actor-critic,
based on [Xu et al., "RL Token"](https://pi.website/research/rlt). An RL-token encoder
compresses S1's observation context into a single bottleneck vector; a TD3 actor refines
S1's reference action chunk while a BC regularizer keeps it close to S1's output. Only
the actor and critic (~2M params) train. See the
**[RLT README](src/lerobot/policies/hvla/rlt/README.md)**.

<p align="center">
  <img alt="RLT online fine-tuning dashboard in the GUI" src="./media/readme/rlt_dashboard.png" width="80%">
</p>

The full upstream policy zoo (ACT, Diffusion, π0 / π0.5, SmolVLA, TDMPC, VQ-BeT,
SAC, …) is intact under [`src/lerobot/policies`](src/lerobot/policies).

## Ephemeral cloud training

From the GUI's training tab you can launch a run on an auto-managed cloud GPU
(Nebius) instead of local hardware. The provider spins up a VM with the training
image, streams logs and live metrics to the dashboard, pulls the trained
checkpoint back to your machine, and tears the VM down when the run reaches a
terminal state — with a cloud-init `poweroff` timer as a hard-TTL backstop so a
forgotten run can't bill indefinitely. Credentials are a single server-held
service-account key, configured once via the Nebius-connection form. See
[`src/lerobot/gui/training`](src/lerobot/gui/training).

## Relationship to upstream

This is a fork of [huggingface/lerobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot)
and periodically tracks it. The core library — dataset format, training/eval
scripts, policy base classes, hardware abstraction — is upstream's; the GUI, MCP
server, HVLA/RLT policies, and cloud-training path are additions here. For
installing the base library, the dataset format, and the standard tutorials,
follow the [upstream docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/index).
