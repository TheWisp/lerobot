"""Subprocess worker that owns one Hub transfer end-to-end.

Spawned by the GUI server, never directly by the user. Reads its config
from the ``LEROBOT_HUB_WORKER_CONFIG`` env var (a JSON blob) at startup
and writes progress + lifecycle state to per-job files the server polls.

The worker is the only place that calls ``huggingface_hub``'s helpers
(`upload_large_folder`, `snapshot_download`, etc.). The server speaks
only to the worker via file IPC and POSIX signals — never to HF directly
for transfer-bound operations.

For the full design see :doc:`gui/docs/hub_transfers.md`.

# ── Fail-fast on unrecoverable HF responses ────────────────────────────────
#
# `huggingface_hub.upload_large_folder` catches HTTP errors at the worker
# level and adaptively shrinks its commit batch on any failure. The
# behavior is intentional for 504 Gateway Timeouts (HF's commit endpoint
# times out validating large batches; shrinking + retrying is the right
# move). But the same blanket `except Exception` swallows 429/401/403/404,
# producing a multi-hour, thousand-attempts-per-minute storm that ignores
# HF's own Retry-After header.
#
# This is a known upstream issue (huggingface/huggingface_hub#3325). The
# sanctioned consumer-side fix is to hook the httpx client HF shares via
# `get_session()` and react to the unrecoverable status codes.
#
# We originally tried raising a BaseException subclass from the hook —
# Python's `except Exception` would skip it and the exception would
# propagate to our outer try in main(). What we missed: HF uses raw
# `threading.Thread`, not `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`. When
# a BaseException raises in a plain Thread, the thread dies with a
# traceback to stderr and the MAIN thread never sees it. The process
# stays wedged.
#
# Real fix: have the hook synchronously write terminal failure state to
# the progress JSON and call `os._exit(1)`. Works from any thread, no
# propagation needed, no library cooperation needed. The `_FatalHFError`
# class is retained for use by tests (which can't tolerate os._exit on
# their process) and as a structured exception type for the abort path.
#
# We deliberately do NOT intercept 5xx codes — that's the case the
# adaptive shrink-and-retry was designed for.
