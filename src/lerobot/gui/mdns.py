"""mDNS / Zeroconf advertising for the GUI host service.

Goal: from any device on the LAN (laptop, phone, tablet) you can open
``http://lerobot.local:<port>/`` and hit your robot host without
knowing its IP. The standard, browser-native mechanism for this is
multicast DNS — modern macOS, Windows 10+, Linux (with avahi-daemon),
iOS, and Android all resolve ``*.local`` hostnames natively.

This module is import-guarded: if ``zeroconf`` isn't installed, or if
multicast is blocked on the network, the advertise call returns None
and the rest of the GUI keeps working. The raw LAN IP printed in the
startup banner is the always-available fallback.

Two consequences worth documenting:

  - Advertising only makes sense when the server binds to a non-loopback
    interface (i.e. ``--host 0.0.0.0`` or a LAN IP). With ``--host
    127.0.0.1`` we'd publish a hostname that resolves to the LAN IP but
    the server wouldn't be reachable from outside the loopback — a
    confusing dead-end for the user. ``advertise()`` checks this and
    declines to publish in the loopback case.

  - If multiple robot hosts on the same LAN both call ``advertise()``
    with the same name, zeroconf's name-conflict logic appends a
    counter (``lerobot-2.local``, ``lerobot-3.local``, ...). The
    actually-used name is returned so the startup banner can show it.
