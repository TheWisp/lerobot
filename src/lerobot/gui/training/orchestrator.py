"""Run orchestrator — starts, polls, stops training runs.

The orchestrator is the bridge between the API layer (which receives Start /
Stop / List from the frontend) and the lower-level pieces:

- :class:`HostRegistry` — picks which transport to use for a given host id
- :class:`TransportClient` — launches / reads from the training process
- :class:`RunRegistry` — persists run metadata + state machine

It does NOT own background polling. The API layer (FastAPI) is expected to
call :meth:`poll` periodically, which reads the structured files the worker
writes and updates the Run's state. This keeps the orchestrator stateless
beyond the registry, so resume across GUI server restarts is automatic.

DESIGN.md § Concurrency:
- Idempotency keys deflect double-Start clicks
- Per-host single-active-run lock prevents two trainings on the same host
- State machine prevents stale duplicate Start from re-running a finished run
