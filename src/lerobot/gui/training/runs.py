"""Run data model + filesystem registry.

A "run" is one invocation of the training pipeline: pick a host, pick a
recipe + dataset, click Start. The Run lives in
``~/.cache/lerobot/runs/<run_id>/`` (configurable via ``RUNS_DIR``):

- ``run.json`` — metadata (recipe, dataset, host, state machine state, pid)
- ``progress.json`` — atomically rewritten on each training step (worker writes)
- ``events.jsonl`` — append-only state transitions (worker writes)
- ``checkpoints.jsonl`` — manifest: one line per completed checkpoint (worker writes)
- ``stderr.log`` — merged stdout + stderr of the training process (worker writes)
- ``checkpoints/<step>/`` — actual checkpoint files (worker writes)

The state machine matches DESIGN.md § Concurrency:
``pending → running → completing → completed / failed / aborted``.

Transitions are gated; you can't go back from a terminal state. Concurrency
defense: the registry's per-host index makes the per-host single-active-run
lock enforceable in one place.
