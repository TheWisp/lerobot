"""Transport layer for training runs: how the GUI server reaches the training process.

Two transports, matching ``scripts/training/DESIGN.md`` § Components:

- :class:`SubprocessTransport` — training runs as a subprocess of the GUI server
  (workstation case). "Host" is the GUI server's own filesystem; all operations
  are local file I/O.
- :class:`SshTransport` — training runs over SSH on a remote host
  (Persistent / Ephemeral cases). Lands in the SSH transport follow-up; stub here.

The :class:`TransportClient` protocol is what the run orchestrator drives. The
operations it needs are intentionally narrow:

- :meth:`launch` — start a detached training process; returns a session id
- :meth:`is_alive` / :meth:`stop` — process lifecycle
- :meth:`read_text` / :meth:`read_bytes_from_offset` — pull the structured
  state files (progress.json, events.jsonl, checkpoints.jsonl, stderr.log) from
  the host without holding an open pipe
- :meth:`fetch_file` — copy a checkpoint file from the host to local storage
