"""Persistent SSH provider — the "BYO SSH endpoint" degenerate case.

User provisioned the VM themselves (on Nebius / RunPod / their lab box /
whatever) and pasted the SSH command into the GUI. We just connect.

Why is this a HostProvider at all, instead of a special case?

Because the rest of the training stack (training_worker, API endpoints,
frontend) talks only to HostProvider. Making the BYO-SSH path implement
the same protocol means there's one code path through the system, not
two. The lifecycle methods are deliberately fail-fast, not no-ops:

  - spawn() raises NotImplementedError — Persistent hosts are added by
    the user via the "Add training host" dialog, not spawned by the GUI.
    The GUI obtains a HostHandle by reading the saved HostProfile, NOT
    by calling spawn().
  - destroy() / verify_destroyed() raise NotImplementedError — the user
    owns the VM lifecycle; the GUI never touches it. Raising (instead of
    a silent no-op + vacuous True) means a caller that reaches for these
    on the wrong host type fails loudly rather than believing resources
    were freed. The C2 teardown sweep iterates GUI-spawned handles only,
    so no legitimate caller ever lands here.
  - cost is zero — the user pays the vendor directly; we don't see it.
    (current_cost IS legitimately called: the UI shows a cost column for
    every host, and $0 is the honest answer for BYO.)
