"""Hub transfer types + shared helpers.

This module is the boundary between the GUI server (FastAPI) and the
worker subprocess that runs one transfer:

* :class:`JobConfig` — the JSON payload the server passes to the worker via
  the ``LEROBOT_HUB_WORKER_CONFIG`` env var. Frozen + JSON-roundtripped.
* :class:`JobPaths` — per-job file paths under ``~/.cache/lerobot/gui/hub_jobs``.
  Both sides compute the same paths from the same job_id.
* :class:`HubJobState` — the in-memory mirror the server keeps, populated
  from the per-job progress JSON file plus server-side bookkeeping.
* helpers — process-identity checks, error classification, file enumeration.

No transfer logic lives here; see :mod:`lerobot.gui.hub_worker` for that.
For the full design see :doc:`gui/docs/hub_transfers.md`.
