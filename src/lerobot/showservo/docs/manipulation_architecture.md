# Key-frame manipulation runtime

The manipulation API has one execution architecture. Every act validates its demo
reference poses, then executes the key-frame runner. `line`, `follow` and `lift`
are key-frame movement modes within that runner. The old marks runner and the
separate grasp/place/world planners have been removed.

Older recordings can still contain named marks such as `pregrasp`, `grasp_end`
and `preplace`. `showservo.motion.key_frames` converts that saved representation
into key frames. This is data-format compatibility, not another execution path.
Act requests cannot select a runner; an obsolete `runner` field is rejected.

## Code ownership

`lerobot.gui.api.manipulation` assembles the endpoint routers. Code imports the
owning module explicitly; there is no `pregrasp.py` forwarding facade.

| Module                  | Responsibility                                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `runtime`               | Shared session data, configuration and dedicated executors                |
| `session`, `camera`     | State readout, frames and calibration from the GUI-owned camera           |
| `acquisition`, `worker` | Object registration, reacquisition and worker job transport               |
| `tracking`              | Geometry verification, acceptance, accepted pose history and following    |
| `holds`                 | Measured object-to-gripper relationships and checked demo reference poses |
| `planning`              | Object-relative key-frame composition, reach checks and landing choices   |
| `execution`             | Reference preflight, the key-frame runner and manual approach controls    |
| `demos`                 | Demo persistence, object designation and key-frame editing                |
| `recording`, `replay`   | Raw/control evidence, trial records, playback and exports                 |
| `rendering`, `groups`   | Overlays and conditional environment-group propagation                    |

Pure registration, rigid-motion calculations and key-frame sample planning live
in `lerobot.showservo.motion`, outside the GUI API. The worker entrypoint is
`benchmarks/manipulation_worker.py`. The HTTP prefix remains `/api/pregrasp` for
compatibility with existing clients and saved scripts; this name does not select
an execution architecture. Camera and arm ownership remain with the GUI.

## Measured-surface correction

P2P proposes a rigid pose. Before control accepts it, `tracking` compares the
reference object's visible surface with the current masked, aligned depth.
`showservo.surface_constraint` can align a supported matching planar patch's
normal and normal offset. This measures two orientation components and one
translation component; tangential position and twist remain from the proposal.
The correction rotates around the predicted reference patch centre and then
moves only along the observed normal. It does not assume a level table or an
upright object and does not change P2P's internal map.

Split-sample agreement, surface span, curvature and local overlap checks decide
whether that plane supports a correction. When a reference plane is supported
but the current plane is not verified, the observation is rejected. For a
non-planar reference, the general surface check may retain an unchanged proposal
when it agrees. Existing visibility, depth and centre-support gates still apply.
Group-motion comparison remains diagnostic; it is not a blanket pose override.

The same surface policy checks acquisition, secondary targets, observations used
for held-object correction, and the saved demo reference poses inverted during
planning. Raw proposals and actual control decisions remain separate in records
and replay. This prevents a corrected live pose from being compared against an
uncorrected, tilted demo reference.

See [pose verification](pose_verification.md) for measured results and limitations.
Visible surface agreement is not independent full-pose ground truth. In-hand
ambiguity and active inspection remain unresolved; this reorganization changes
neither the estimator policy nor its measured performance.

## Regression coverage

The key-frame runner is tested against expected grasp, carry, placement, drop,
reach, occlusion and hold-correction behavior. Planner tests verify reference
poses, recorded follow samples, timing, gripper commands, joint hints and floor
references directly. They no longer require a second implementation as an oracle.
Persisted mark-to-key-frame conversion, old replay records and the HTTP routes
retain their own compatibility checks.
