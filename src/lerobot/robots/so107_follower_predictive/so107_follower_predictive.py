"""SO-107 follower with the predictive-lookahead controller built in.

This is treated as a SEPARATE EMBODIMENT from the plain ``so107_follower``
even though the hardware is identical, because the trained-policy contract
is materially different:

  * ``so107_follower``: ``state(t) ≈ leader(t − τ)`` — motor lag visible in
    every observation. Policy implicitly compensates τ via action chunks.

  * ``so107_follower_predictive``: ``state(t) ≈ intent(t)`` — controller
    transparently compensates motor τ. Dataset has aligned action/state
    pairs at matching timestamps. Policy never observes τ.

Mixing datasets across the two regimes in training is a real hazard:
training-time state-action alignment would be inconsistent and the policy
would output actions that lurch when deployed. The robot_type
separation makes this prevention automatic — recording / training /
inference all key off the same ``robot_type`` string.

Architecture: controller logic lives in this module only. Caller-facing
interface (``Robot.send_action``, ``Robot.get_observation``) is unchanged.
A 200 Hz background thread does the actual motor writes; the caller's
``send_action(intent)`` is non-blocking and just publishes the latest
intent to the controller.

Lifted from scripts/proto_decoupled_teleop.py with the amplitude-gated
cross-correlation patch from commit 7a1e92c61.

# ============================================================================
# Predictive-lookahead controller — private to this module.
# ============================================================================
#
# Lifted from scripts/proto_decoupled_teleop.py with the amplitude-gated
# cross-correlation patch (commit 7a1e92c61). Adapted to live inside the
# robot:
#
#   - Intent source: prototype reads from a ``teleop`` object every control
#     tick. Here the caller pushes intent via ``robot.send_action(intent)``,
#     which calls ``set_intent``. The control thread polls the latest
#     pushed intent on its own schedule.
#   - State source: prototype's planning thread does its own sync_read.
#     Here state is fed via ``robot.get_observation()`` → ``observe_state``,
#     so only one reader touches the bus.
#   - Bus lock: prototype owns ``bus_lock``. Here we share the robot's
#     ``_bus_lock`` so this controller and the main-thread read coordinate.
#
# What's deliberately rough (prototype, not production):
#   - ``max_relative_target`` safety clamp from SOFollower is not applied
#     here. Only the smaller ``max_step_deg`` per-tick clamp is enforced.
#     The bigger safety bound should be wired in before this hits production.
#   - No latency-monitor integration yet. The controller's L history,
#     residual lag, and adaptive update logs aren't published to the GUI
#     dashboard.
#   - No tests. The hardware-side validation lives in the prototype script
#     (scripts/proto_decoupled_teleop.py); the algorithmic regression
#     coverage lives in scripts/backtest_lookahead.py and
#     scripts/sim_adaptive_lookahead.py.

            t: Caller-side ``time.perf_counter()`` at the moment of publish.
                Drives velocity estimation in the dict path — by stamping
                with the caller's timestamp (not the controller's tick
                time), the velocity estimator's observed dts reflect the
                source's actual sample period, making it rate-agnostic.
            action: Single-frame ``RobotAction`` dict OR an ``ActionChunk``.
                Dict → velocity-extrapolation path. Chunk → exact-lookup
                path (``_lookup_in_chunk``); velocity estimator bypassed.
            period_s: Optional caller-declared publish period (e.g. 1/30
                for a 30 Hz policy). Enables starvation detection. When
                omitted on the chunk path, auto-inferred as ``1/action.fps``.

        For an ``ActionChunk``, ``frames[0]`` is the "current intent" used
        as the fallback when the chunk is consumed. The rest of the chunk
        is held under ``_latest_chunk`` for the control thread's
        exact-lookup path.

        For a single ``RobotAction`` dict, ``_latest_chunk`` is cleared so
        subsequent ticks fall back to velocity extrapolation. The push
        path also appends ``(t, current_intent)`` to ``_intent_ring`` —
        this is the source's publish event timestamped at the source's
        clock, so the velocity estimator sees dts that reflect the
        caller's actual sample rate. Identical-value samples are NOT
        deduped: a steady-state hold from the caller IS information
        ("velocity is zero now"), not redundant data.

        NB: ``_intent_log`` is NOT populated here. It's populated from
        ``_tick`` instead, at the control rate, so the adaptive xcorr can
        use ``control_dt`` as its time unit cleanly (matches the
        prototype in scripts/proto_decoupled_teleop.py where ``leader_log``
        is appended inside the control loop). Logging here would have
        sample spacing = caller rate (typically 30 Hz), and the xcorr
        would mis-convert index shifts to time by a factor of
        ``caller_rate / control_rate``.

        Rate-invariant: the EMA α (set in ``set_intent``) is keyed on the
        publish-to-publish dt so the filter cutoff is ``velocity_lowpass_hz``
        whether publishes arrive at 30 Hz or 200 Hz. The control tick rate
        only affects how often this method is sampled; the value it
        produces depends only on time and the publish stream.

        NO amplitude gate. The original ``amp_gated_lp`` estimator added a
        window-based amplitude gate to suppress lookahead amplification of
        residual estimator noise. In the stateful path:
          * Tremor is already attenuated by the EMA's velocity_lowpass_hz
            cutoff (default 4 Hz → 10 Hz tremor band reduced ~3×).
          * Stationary intent → v_lp converges to 0 → no lookahead by
            construction.
          * The per-step clamp (max_step_deg) caps any residual jitter.
        Adding a window-p2p gate here would re-introduce the same
        sample-count flicker that the stateful design eliminates — at
        30 Hz publishes the window holds 2-3 entries and the gate value
        oscillates between rate-dependent values every publish period.

        Stale-publish safety: if no publish has arrived within
        ``velocity_window_s`` of ``now``, return the latest intent
        unchanged (no lookahead) and clear the stored state so the next
