"""Bimanual SO-107 follower with predictive-lookahead controllers on both arms.

Composes two ``SO107FollowerPredictive`` instances — one per arm. Each
arm owns its own ``FeetechMotorsBus`` and its own 200 Hz controller
thread; the buses are independent, so the two controllers don't
contend on anything. The composer's job is just argument routing and
joint-name prefix translation (``left_*`` / ``right_*``), identical
to plain ``BiSO107Follower``.

Why per-arm threads instead of one shared loop driving both:

  * Bus blip isolation. A transient Feetech retry on one bus (~10 ms)
    would stall the shared loop and delay the other arm's writes.
    Two threads × two buses keeps the slow side from infecting the
    fast side.
  * Independent adaptive L. The two arms have measurably different
    motor τ in practice (one bus is over-cabled in white profile,
    the other isn't). Each arm's amplitude-gated xcorr converges to
    its own τ. Sharing one L would force the wrong tuning on at
    least one arm.
  * Phase drift between arms is ≤ 1 control period = 5 ms at 200 Hz —
    below motor response time and below the human-teleop floor, so
    losing per-tick sync of the goal issue costs nothing measurable.
  * ``SO107FollowerPredictive`` stays self-contained and re-usable as
    a single-arm robot; the bimanual is just two of them stacked.

GIL note: ``bus.sync_write`` releases the GIL during the serial I/O,
so the two writer threads progress in parallel even on CPython.

Distinct ``robot_type`` (``bi_so107_follower_predictive``) so the
training-side embodiment contract is unambiguous — see the module
docstring on ``SO107FollowerPredictive`` for the long-form rationale.
