class SO107LeaderHighRateConfig(SO107LeaderConfig):
    """SO-107 Leader configuration with a background bus-read thread.

    Inherits every field of :class:`SO107LeaderConfig` (port,
    use_degrees, gripper_bounce, intervention_enabled) and adds a
    single knob — the rate at which the background thread polls the
    leader bus. ``get_action()`` returns the cached pose without
    touching the bus, so callers (the 30 Hz record loop AND the
    predictive controller's 200 Hz tick when attached) all see fresh
    samples without contending on a serial port.

    The point of the high-rate read is for the **consumer** to have
    access to distinct intent samples at a rate close to the leader's
    natural bandwidth. With the default ``read_rate_hz=200``, a
    consumer polling at 200 Hz gets ~14 distinct samples in a 70 ms
    velocity-LSQ window vs. the ~2 distinct samples it gets when the
    leader is sampled at the record loop's 30 Hz. The LSQ velocity
    estimate's under-shoot bias (≈ ½·window = 35 ms when sampled at
    30 Hz) collapses.
    """

    # Background poll rate. 200 Hz matches the predictive follower's
    # control_rate_hz so the consumer's velocity LSQ sees one fresh
    # sample per tick. Don't go higher than the Feetech bus can
    # actually sustain — empirically ~170-200 Hz with P=48 sync_read
    # of 7 motors per arm. Going higher just produces serial timeouts.
    read_rate_hz: float = 200.0
