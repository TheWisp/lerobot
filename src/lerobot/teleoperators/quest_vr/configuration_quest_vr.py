_PORT_DESC = (
    "HTTPS / WebSocket port the WebXR page is served on. The Quest 3 browser "
    "opens https://<your-LAN-IP>:<port>/ to enter the immersive session. A "
    "self-signed cert is auto-generated into the package directory on first "
    "run; the Quest will show a warning once per device, then remember it. "
    "Default 8443 is the standard HTTPS-alternate port."
)
_CLUTCH_DESC = (
    "Which Quest controller button toggles arm tracking (rising-edge engages, "
    "release disengages). Default 1 = grip / squeeze side button on Quest 3. "
    "While released, the arm freezes its commanded pose; the gripper is "
    "still operable so you can release objects without engaging the arm."
)
_GRIPPER_DESC = (
    "Which Quest controller button drives the gripper. Default 0 = analog "
    "index trigger. The trigger value (0..1) is mapped absolutely to motor "
    "position: trigger=0 -> gripper_open_motor, trigger=1 -> "
    "gripper_closed_motor. No integration / velocity tracking, so the "
    "trigger feels like a continuous open/close knob with no latching."
)
_GRIPPER_OPEN_DESC = (
    "Motor-space position commanded when the trigger is fully released "
    "(grip=0). Calibrate by physically opening the gripper to where you "
    "want trigger-released to land and reading the motor position."
)
_GRIPPER_CLOSED_DESC = (
    "Motor-space position commanded when the trigger is fully pulled "
    "(grip=1). Motor direction differs across calibrations — closing the "
    "gripper might mean increasing OR decreasing motor.pos depending on "
    "how zero was set during calibration. So this value can be either "
    "larger or smaller than gripper_open_motor; pick whatever matches "
    "the physically-closed pose. The bimanual SO-107 default has "
    "closed=90 on the left arm (opens-as-decreasing) and closed=10 on "
    "the right (opens-as-increasing)."
)
_POSITION_SCALE_DESC = (
    "Hand-motion to robot-EE motion ratio. 1.0 = 1:1 (push hand 5 cm -> EE "
    "moves 5 cm). Use values <1 for finer control of small tasks, >1 if you "
    "need to cover a workspace larger than your reach."
)
_MAX_ROT_DESC = (
    "Caps the magnitude (in radians) of the rotation delta from the engage "
    "snapshot. Despite the name this is an absolute cap on |delta_rot|, not "
    "a per-tick rate limit. Default 3.14 rad (pi) = effectively uncapped — "
    "the wrist tracks the controller through any reachable angle. Lower it "
    "(e.g. 0.5 rad = 28 deg) only if you want a stiffer 'small rotations "
    "only' feel; the prior 0.5 default felt limited because you'd hit the "
    "cap on any meaningful wrist motion."
)
_MAX_POS_VEL_DESC = (
    "Per-WebXR-frame cap on the Quest controller's POSITION delta (meters). "
    "Suppresses tracking glitches: a 380mm jump in 33ms is 11 m/s, clearly "
    "not real hand motion. The Quest streams at ~90 Hz while the teleop loop "
    "polls at 30 Hz, so multiple WebXR frames overwrite the cached action "
    "between loop ticks — this cap applies to each WebXR frame individually. "
    "Default 0.04 m/frame allows ~3.6 m/s at 90 Hz (faster than typical "
    "teleop, slower than tracking-teleport glitches). Set 0.0 to disable."

class QuestVRTeleopConfig(TeleoperatorConfig):
    """Quest 3 WebXR teleop: both controllers drive both robot arms.

    One Quest browser session opens the served WebXR page, enters an
    immersive session, and streams poses for *both* controllers in each
    frame. One server callback dispatches to two per-arm controllers,
    cached under a lock; ``get_action()`` takes the same lock briefly to
    copy it out. Sample-rate (Quest WebXR, ~90 Hz) is fully decoupled
    from poll-rate (loop driver, 30 Hz).

    Quest is always bimanual — there is no unimanual variant. Action
    keys are prefixed: ``left_*`` for the left controller, ``right_*``
    for the right.

    Output action keys (per-arm end-effector deltas; the robot's
    ``attach_teleop`` installs the Cartesian-IK transform that turns them
    into joints):
        left_enabled, left_target_x/y/z, left_target_wx/wy/wz, left_gripper_pos,
        right_enabled, right_target_x/y/z, right_target_wx/wy/wz, right_gripper_pos

    Per-arm clutch and gripper buttons are independent; clutch one
    controller to drive that arm without affecting the other.
