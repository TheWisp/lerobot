"""Configuration for Flow Matching S1 action policy.

Action expert conditioned on:
  - DINOv2 image features (same backbone as ACTWithVLM)
  - S2 latent [2048] + age embedding
  - Robot state [action_dim]
  - Training-time RTC: simulated delay + inpainting prefix

No VLM in S1 — S2 handles scene understanding via shared latent.

    """Config for FlowMatchingS1Policy.

    Architecture follows Pi0/SmolVLA action expert design:
    - Observation encoder (DINOv2 + state + S2 latent) → context tokens
    - Flow matching decoder with cross-attention to context
    - Action+timestep fusion via concat → MLP(SiLU) (matching Pi0/SmolVLA)
