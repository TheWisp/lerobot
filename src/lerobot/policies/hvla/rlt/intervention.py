"""InterventionRecorder — owns the human-action → replay-buffer pipeline
during intervention episodes.

A small focused class so that (a) the main loop stays uncluttered, and
(b) we have a single call site at which to assert the ``z_rl``
precondition. A regression in the upstream inference-thread plumbing
fails loudly on the first intervention frame instead of silently
dropping data.

Behavior (Paper Alg 1 lines 9, 11, 12 during intervention):
    * Each frame: human action is appended to an internal C-frame buffer.
    * At the start of each C-frame window: z_rl + state are snapshotted.
    * When a window completes: write a transition to the replay buffer
      pairing the previous window with the current (s, a, r=0, s').
      action == ref == human_chunk (so BC penalty is zero on human data).

The assert in ``on_frame`` catches the specific failure mode where the
upstream inference thread stops exposing a fresh ``z_rl`` during
intervention. See InferenceThread for the producer side."""
