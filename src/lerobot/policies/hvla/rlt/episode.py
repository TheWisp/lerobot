"""Episode-level lifecycle state for RLT online RL.

Owns the per-episode mutable state that the main thread sets via the
operator's keyboard handlers (R / LEFT / DOWN / SPACE) and the
inference thread reads when deciding what reward / done flags to
attach to each transition.

Replaces the prior dict-based flags (``reward_triggered`` /
``abort_triggered`` / ``ignore_triggered``) which had a structural
race: the inference thread re-read them on every cycle while the
main thread didn't reset them until the *end* of post-episode
bookkeeping. Any inference cycle that fired in the window between
the operator's keypress and the flag reset wrote another transition
flagged ``done=True``. Real bug observed at ep124: 17 ``done=True``
transitions written instead of 1.

The fix here is structural, not just a flag-reset reorder: terminal
consumption is one-shot per episode, enforced by an internal
``_terminal_consumed`` flag inside this class. Even if the inference
thread fires N times during the post-signal window, only the first
``consume_terminal_for_storage()`` call returns the terminal kind;
all subsequent calls return ``None`` and the inference thread writes
``done=False, reward=0``.

See also ``tests/hvla/test_rlt_episode.py`` for the invariants this
class enforces and the threading test that locks in the race-free
behavior.
