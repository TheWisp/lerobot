class TransactionalReplayBuffer:
    """Replay buffer with database-style transaction semantics:
    ``add()`` writes are *pending* until ``commit()`` (= move into the
    underlying committed buffer) or ``discard()`` (= drop them). The
    pending writes are invisible to ``sample()`` and to ``len()`` —
    the only externally observable state is the committed buffer.

    Used here at episode granularity: each episode is one
    transaction. ``commit()`` runs at success / abort / fail / timeout
    (every outcome that should keep the data); ``discard()`` runs at
    IGNORE (the operator pressed DOWN to throw out the episode).

    **Invariant**: ``sample()`` returns ONLY committed transitions.
    Pending writes are invisible to the gradient-update sampling
    path until the transaction ends. This makes IGNORE provably
    zero-impact on training: discarded writes never reach the
    sampler, so the critic and actor never see them.

    The previous design (``ReplayBuffer.add`` directly +
    ``truncate(ep_start_size)`` on IGNORE) had a structural leak:
    grad updates fired during the episode could sample the
    in-progress transitions before the truncate call ever ran. Small
    in expectation but non-zero.

    Drop-in replacement at the public API level (``add`` / ``sample``
    / ``__len__`` / ``capacity`` / ``save`` / ``load``). Private
    attribute access (``_action``, ``_z_rl``, ``ptr``, etc.) forwards
    to the committed buffer via ``__getattr__`` so existing call sites
    that poke internals (e.g. for cross-module assertions) keep
    working.

    Cost: writes from transaction N only become sampleable after
    ``commit()`` lands them in committed (i.e., starting in
    transaction N+1 if commits are scoped to transactions). With
    UTD=5 and ~25 grad updates/s wall-clock, that's ~250 grad steps
    of staleness per transaction boundary. Acceptable trade for the
    structural guarantee.
