"""Per-iteration latency tracer for real-time loops.

Each iteration records (start_ms, end_ms) offsets per span (relative to
``iter_start``), plus per-camera (captured_at_ms, consumed_at_ms) pairs
where ``captured_at_ms`` may be negative (cameras grab in a background
thread before the iteration begins). Together these reconstruct a Gantt
timeline of one iteration — see ``src/lerobot/gui/docs/latency_monitoring.md``.

Why timestamp pairs instead of just durations:
- Visual gap detection in the Gantt replaces the previous numeric
  ``residual_ms`` cross-check.
- Overlapping work (camera capture vs. main-loop work) is representable.
- The same primitive serves teleop and policy without loop-kind branching.

Per-stage duration scalars (``motor_read_ms``, etc.) are still emitted in
the record — derived from the span's end-start — so the dashboard's
sparklines and percentile queries are unchanged.
