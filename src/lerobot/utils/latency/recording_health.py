"""Post-recording quality summaries.

Two surfaces share the same primitives:

  - **End-of-episode warning**: ``lerobot_record`` calls ``summarize`` and
    ``verdict`` after each ``save_episode`` so an inattentive operator
    gets a loud ``log_say`` if the episode had frame-rate violations —
    they can press the rerecord-episode key while the warning is still
    fresh, rather than discovering the problem post-hoc.

  - **Persistent per-episode metadata**: the same summary is appended to
    ``<dataset.root>/meta/episodes_health.jsonl`` so the data panel /
    visualizer can render quality badges next to each episode without
    re-computing anything.

These functions are pure — they take a list of records (which the caller
filters by episode if they want per-episode stats) and return a dict.
Pure makes them trivial to test and to call from anywhere a list of
records is available.
